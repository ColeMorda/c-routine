 * FAQ:
 *      Q: What is this?
 *      A: This is a lightweight, header-only coroutine system for C.
 *         It allows you to write functions that can "pause" and "resume" execution
 *         at certain points, without using threads or operating system-level context switching.
 *         C_ROUTINES are useful for tasks like:
 *             - Long-running operations that you want to split across multiple frames (game loops, simulations)
 *             - Asynchronous I/O without blocking
 *             - Generators or lazy iterators
 *             - State machines
 *
 *      Q: How do I use this?
 *      A: An example of a simple C_ROUTINE can be found in example.c
 *
 *      Q: AHHH!!!! IT LOOKS LIKE PYTHON!!!!
 *      A: RELAX!!! Look, I know indentation sucks, but trust me, this is pure C.
 *         C_ROUTINES use switch statements to evaluate what state the C_ROUTINE is currently in,
 *         so you technically don't even need the indents.
 *         If it helps, there's a few things you can do:
 *         - Buy some curly bracket stickers and stick them to your monitor where the colons appear
 *         - Think happy thoughts. "I love manual memory management", "Abstraction is evil", etc.
 *         - Use Lua for your project instead. If it's good enough for Cloudflare, it's good enough for you.
 ****************************************************************************************************************
 * FLAGS:
 *      -DC_ROUTINE_UNSAFE_SHORTHANDS: Allows use of potentially conflicting shorthand macros such as ONEND.
 *      -DC_ROUTINE_MANUAL_STATE: Disables the automatic state handler, This means you must explicitly define each state in C_ROUTINE_YIELD, (e.g. C_ROUTINE_YIELD(0))
 ****************************************************************************************************************
